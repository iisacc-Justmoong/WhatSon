# `src/app/main.cpp`

## Runtime Wiring Notes
- `WhatSonRuntimeParallelLoader` is now instantiated in `main.cpp` and injected into `WhatSonStartupRuntimeCoordinator` through `setParallelLoader(...)`.
- Calendar and system calendar stores continue to be instantiated concretely here, but downstream collaborators now consume interface types.
- `main.cpp` now keeps the concrete `CalendarBoardStore` synchronized with the currently loaded hub path and refreshes
  calendar note projections from the live `LibraryHierarchyViewModel` snapshot after startup load, onboarding load,
  sync reload, and library-originated mutations.
- `main.cpp` also injects a live library-note provider into `CalendarBoardStore`, so calendar queries can lazily
  resolve projected note items even before an explicit projection reload has populated the cache.
- Bookmark/progress-originated note mutations still use the disk reindex fallback path so calendar projection remains
  aligned even when those domains mutate note metadata outside the library viewmodel's in-memory note list.
- Hub selection wiring now updates sync/import state directly without a background write-lease heartbeat timer.
- This keeps the application bootstrap as the composition root for concrete object selection.
