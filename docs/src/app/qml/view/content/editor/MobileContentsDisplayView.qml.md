# `src/app/qml/view/content/editor/MobileContentsDisplayView.qml`

## Responsibility
Mobile content editor host.

## Structured Document Flow
- Mobile now mirrors the desktop structured-flow editor path for notes that contain `agenda`, `callout`, or `break`
  blocks.
- `ContentsStructuredDocumentFlow.qml` becomes the visible editor surface for those notes, while the legacy inline
  editor remains the fallback for purely plain-text notes.
- Structured block rewrites route through `applyDocumentSourceMutation(...)` so mobile keeps the same RAW persistence
  contract as desktop.
